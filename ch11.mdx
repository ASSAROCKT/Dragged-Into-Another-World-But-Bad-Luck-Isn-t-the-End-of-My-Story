They decided to head straight home after seeing **Ronald** that day, but they returned the next day after confirming he wasn't there.

"Oh, he rarely comes by, so you don't need to worry about him that much."

The receptionist at the quest counter said with a wry smile.

According to her, Ronald was the first person in decades to possess the "**Hero**" **Job Skill**. From Harold's perspective, he felt like spitting on the ground and thinking, _If that's a Hero, we're doomed, but he kept his expression neutral. Or rather, he tried his absolute best to.

Because of his **Job Skill**, Ronald had even been granted a surname. He was two years older than them, which should make him fourteen, but apparently, he already had a flock of admirers. His arrogant behavior at the **Adventurer's Guild** was typical, he acted as if being the **Hero** gave him the right to do whatever he wanted.

"The kingdom can't exactly let the **Hero** leave for another country, so they grant him a certain degree of special treatment, but his behavior yesterday was just too much. They've decided to make the Kingdom's Department of Magic the sole point of contact for him now."

Apparently, the incident yesterday had blown up into a huge mess after Harold and Aaron left. When Harold smiled at the troubled-looking receptionist and said, "I see. Thank you," a loud crash came from behind him.

"AHHHHHHHH!! The handle came off!?"

A boy holding a door handle turned around slowly, his face pale.

"You're paying for that."

A muscular guild member clapped the boy on the shoulder.

_Yeah, that figures_, the onlookers seemed to agree. Just how much force would it take to snap a door handle clean off?

"No way..."

The boy was stunned, but it's common sense that if you break something, you fix it. He was dejectedly led away. He looked about the same age as Harold and Aaron and was wearing well-made clothes for a commoner. He seemed to be the son of a fairly wealthy family, but in most cases, even for nobles, any son who wasn't the heir had to make his own way in the world or marry into another family. Harold decided not to dwell on what the boy's family situation might be.

The variety of monsters changed now that they were in the royal capital. They were told there were dungeons, too, but the pair wasn't looking to earn a fortune. They were more the type who wanted to "safely build up a small nest egg, just enough to get by in the academy without trouble." The dungeons near the capital weren't particularly high-level, but they had no intention of entering one without doing some proper research first.

Harold and Aaron's families were worried about them. Having no desire to make their families sad, the two agreed to take a cautious, look-before-you-leap approach.

"Stick to boars to be safe?"

“Yeah. We should check out the area and see what monsters are around before figuring out what matches our level.”

Several guild members watched the two with a sense of relief. After all, the current **Hero**, who had arrived about two years ago, had a track record of marching into areas with monsters far beyond his capabilities and causing utter chaos. Besides him, it wasn't uncommon for youths from the countryside to get a big head after being accepted into the academy, thinking they were special and talented.

This time of year was always tense, as the number of "incidents" caused by such people tended to spike. In that context, the boys' caution was a welcome sight.

After consulting, the two accepted a quest for gathering herbs and subjugating boars, then left.

Not long after, an adventurer burst in, shouting, "A kid who looks like he's from the countryside is being chased by a C-rank monster!!"

_It's that time of year again_, thought the staff and adventurers on standby as they rushed out.
