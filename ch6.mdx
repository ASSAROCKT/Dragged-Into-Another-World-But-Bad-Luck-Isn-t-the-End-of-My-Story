Because this was a region with many monsters, mutual support was essential.

The boy smiling next to him, Aaron, was his partner in hunting. Aaron's father had died fighting monsters, and he lived in a family of four with his mother, younger brother, and younger sister. He was also the one who, when he first met Harold, had clapped him on the shoulder and earnestly said, "Watch yourself so you don’t get snatched away" 

Though rare in this area, Harold had been targeted by human traffickers and slave traders before, and he had replied in a deadpan tone with eyes like a dead fish, "I know."

The two of them ended up teaming up after reuniting at the Adventurer's Guild.

Harold was delivering medicinal herbs and a boar-type monster called a Boarhound, while Aaron had just taken down a Black Eagle, a jet-black eagle-type monster unique to this area. The two talked while waiting for their items to be assessed. You could also say Aaron was the one who initiated the conversation. Until Harold moved in, there were no other boys his age in the village, so for Aaron, a same-age male friend (candidate) was a precious existence.

When Harold mentioned that he used magic to hunt, it was Aaron who suggested they team up to secure food. He could tell Harold was a serious person just by watching his daily life, and when Aaron's younger brother asked about how to identify herbs, Harold had taught him kindly. Having seen such moments, Aaron thought Harold might be surprisingly caring. He pushed forward, thinking he could win him over.

In the end, Harold agreed, judging, "Well, it's probably safer with two people."

"You're really good at processing the kill."

"Only the processing, though. You're a better cook."

"That's 'cause my mom taught me directly!"

Harold's expression softened at his partner's grin.

This pair of boys was quite greedy when it came to food. That might have been partly due to the seasonings Harold processed and created.

In this rural part of another world, seasonings were scarce. Even things like salt were unobtainable unless a merchant came by. Sugar and pepper were things you could only get if you were lucky.

Or so it was.

"Who would've thought you could make a sugar substitute by boiling down those white flowers that grow all year round?"

"It was great how you could process those inedible tree nuts into a pepper substitute, too."

"Now we just need to find something that's like salt."

His planted crops weren't stolen, and he could barter with people. The herbs he planted weren't ravaged. His work wasn't interrupted.

That alone significantly expanded Harold's range of activities. Now that he was in a situation where he could explore, his Magic Eye (Appraisal) came to life. Of course, regular sugar and other seasonings were of better quality. However, it was difficult to use those somewhat expensive items as much as he'd like.

After they finished processing the kill, sand-colored crow-type monsters called Scarcrows came, aiming for the carcass. They have developed beaks that can crush even bones to eat. It's said that in their habitat, not even the bones of a corpse remain.

Aaron drew his bow on the flying creature. As if to mock him, the Scarcrow circled, confident that an arrow could never hit something that soared so freely through the sky.

"Annoying."

"Should I stop its movement?"

"It's fine. **It'll hit.**"

Hearing Aaron's words, Harold nodded and began preparing to carry the prey home. He hoisted a plump, duck-like bird and a BoarHound the size of himself onto his shoulders and started walking. The instant the Scarcrow tried to move toward him, an arrow pierced straight through its neck. It fell and died on the spot.

"This thing doesn't even taste good."

Aaron pouted with a hint of dissatisfaction but quickly told Harold that he would help carry the load.

"It's fine until we get down the mountain. These things are persistent, they might still be targeting us."

"You're right."

Aaron nodded bitterly, as if he'd had his prey stolen before. Then, he let out a sigh of envy as he watched Harold carry the large animals with ease.

_(How the hell does a skinny guy like him carry that much? I’m the one with the bigger build!)_

And to make matters worse, he had the face of a noble. Dangerously good-looking, honestly.

They shot down several more Scarcrows by the time they neared the village, then readjusted their haul between the two of them and headed for the Adventurer's Guild.

"How can you carry something like that so easily?"

While waiting for the assessment and dismantling, Aaron asked him that, and Harold replied, "I'm just using strength-enhancing magic," before leading him to the reference room. He flipped to the page of the designated material and showed it to him. Aaron, who hadn't connected magic with physical strength, was a little surprised.

"You'll probably be able to do it pretty quickly, I think."

Harold didn't use Appraisal on people because it felt wrong, but he had felt a surge of magical power when Aaron drew his bow. That's why he said it on a whim. He would find out just how right he was three days later.
