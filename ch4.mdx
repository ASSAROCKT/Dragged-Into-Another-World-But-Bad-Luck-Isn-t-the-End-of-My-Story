The next morning, Harold returned to the house he shared with Myna, accompanied by his grandparents. However, Myna was nowhere to be seen. On the desk, there was a piece of wrapping paper. Thinking it hadn't been there when they left the house, he picked it up, and in that instant, the air around Harold changed. 

His grandfather, Eugene, sensing that his grandson was suppressing his anger, called out to him by his nickname, "Haru." His normally cheerful and charming grandson wordlessly handed him the paper, and Eugene had a bad feeling.

"That... damned daughter of mine!!"

On the paper, written in messy handwriting, were the words "Goin away frum home a bit." She probably couldn't pronounce "leave" because she was barely literate. In this territory, swindling of commoners by malicious people was frequent when his grandparents were young, so they were provided with a basic education in writing to reduce the chances of it happening. For a moment, Eugene couldn't grasp what the note meant, but now that he understood, his anger was immense.

Eugene and his wife had tried to set Myna straight. Despite their efforts, Myna was doted on by the men around her, got together with a man of similar character, and when her husband ran off, she would weep pitifully only to wrap another man around her finger. Perhaps because Harold was so serious and well-behaved, whatever affection he had left for his daughter was not just gone it had been burned to ashes by this note.

Afterward, Ronald and his family arrived again, and the discussion began anew.

Harold tended to his grandmother, who had fainted from dizziness, all while watching his enraged grandfather, his shameless childhood friend who brazenly said, "She invited me, so I just took what was offered," Ronald’s mother who looked like she was about to foam at the mouth, and Ronald's pale-faced father.

Ultimately, they came to the conclusion that it was too cruel for Harold and Peter if they remained in the village, so it was decided that Harold and his grandparents would leave. They even made a promise that if Myna ever came back, they could “do as they pleased with her.” In any case, she was a person who couldn't do anything on her own. It was possible she had already been sold.

_(If she ran away and abandoned her own child, she can't complain if the same thing happens to her.)_

In reality, the reason Harold’s grandparents decided to abandon Myna was that she had abandoned Harold. She might claim she never intended to, but she hadn’t left a single word of concern.

Furthermore, a witness testimony even surfaced stating that she had struck Harold’s cheek as she left with Ronald.

Incidentally, while Ronald was being fiercely scolded, he just looked confused. “It’s not like I did anything wrong, right?” What on earth had happened to his sense of ethics and common sense?

"I mean, she invited me, the lady was beautiful, and I was interested in... that kind of thing."

_(Are all twelve-year-olds in this world like this?)_

As Harold was recoiling in confusion, Ronald’s mother shrieked, “What were you going to do if she got pregnant!?” Ronald had been laughing nonchalantly, but such acts can create life. Harold wanted to distance himself even more from a person who didn't care about such things.

It took some time to prepare for their departure from the village. In the meantime, as if thinking, _“You can do whatever you want to the child of a parent who would lay a hand on another child,”_ their crops were ravaged, and their traps were deliberately broken. Stones were thrown at their house, and the people around them laughed at their plight.

_(Is vigilante justice this satisfying in every world?)_

Harold didn't voice any complaints, but that didn't mean he wasn't angry. He thought, “We don't deserve to be treated this way,” but he didn't believe it would change or end the current situation. In fact, it was highly likely to escalate. He was also aware that if he resisted strangely, he would be the one to get hurt.

_(And I have this uselessly pretty face, too...)_

With that thought, he snuck to his secret spot and harvested the medicinal herbs he had been cultivating, roots and all. Harold was the one who found them and made them multiply in the first place. Even if they no longer grew here, they could be found deeper in the mountains if one was lucky. The villagers could just search desperately for them.

The herbs here would sell for a decent price at the Adventurer's Guild. The fact that they sold meant they were needed. Because he hadn't revealed the supply route, some people had been tailing him. He had been targeted in every sense since he was little. He was good at hiding. That was how he had barely managed to keep this place secret and was now able to retrieve its contents.

He put them not in a normal bag, but into his Dimensional Storage. Otherwise, there was a high chance his bag would be snatched and the contents stolen.

The harassment was so severe that Harold and his grandparents moved up their schedule and left the village. Fortunately, there was an adventurer at the **Adventurer's Guild** who accepted their request for an escort.

"You've had it rough too, kid."

The adventurer was an outsider who had been staying in the village for several months in search of rare monsters. The young man at the guild reception had recommended him, saying he was trustworthy as his record was managed by the Adventurer's Association. Harold, who always diligently completed jobs like gathering herbs and cleaning, was fairly well-regarded at the **Adventurer's Guild**. It might also have been because the guild was mostly staffed by people from outside the village.

“Well, it’s because of that mother of mine.”

The adventurer, who had only ever seen the gentle and calm expression on Harold’s face, made a strained face upon seeing him look so blank. Harold had never liked the village to begin with, but the fact that he was being driven out also angered him.

In any case, he hadn't been able to live the easy life he had hoped for before his reincarnation, not even a little. Now, more than ever, he was filled with the desire to live a more carefree life.
