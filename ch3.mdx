At Ronald’s house, where Harold reluctantly carried the baggage, his younger brother puffed out his cheeks. 

“You’re not my big brother!?”

Even though the boy said that, it was his own brother who had forced the task on Harold. With a wry smile, Harold handed over the luggage, but the boy, Peter, must have thought his brother was nearby, because he started following him.

Harold thought this could turn into a hassle, but decided he’d just go about his work as usual. He didn’t know what life was like for nobles, but as a commoner, if he didn’t work, life would simply get harder. His mother was useless, and his grandparents had their own lives to manage. He was old enough now that he couldn’t just keep being a burden.

He sighed when he found the traps he’d set in the hunting grounds near the village were empty. With any luck, he could catch a rabbit or a small monster, but there was no harvest today. 

"Nothing to be done about it," he thought, and as he stood up, Ronald’s brother Peter asked, 

“Wouldn’t it be better to go hunting than to set traps in a place like this?”

“My bow and arrows I had kept hidden are gone. Well… I’m guessing it’s my mom.”

“Hmph. That woman is nothing but trouble, isn’t she.”

Even a child from another family was saying such things about her. And Harold had no words to offer in her defense. Even Peter understood that Harold had a hard time in the village because of Myna. It couldn’t be helped. Not many people would want to get involved with someone carrying that kind of burden. 

Harold could declare with certainty that if she weren’t his own mother, he wouldn’t go near her. The only reason he lived with her was because “it lessens the burden on my grandparents.” His grandparents worried about him and told him not to mind such things, but Harold knew. If he stayed at his grandparents' house, his toxic, deadbeat mother would follow him there. Even now, at ten years old, Harold was doing most of the housework. If he went back to his grandparents' home, she would surely do even less.

_(If I weren't me, Harold, then my grandparents would have had to deal with a disaster of a daughter and a disaster of a son. It would have been more than they could handle.)_

Myna believed that if you had a pretty face, people would help you out no matter what. That’s why she would try to stop Harold whenever he did farm work or went hunting, fearing it would ruin his looks.

Harold sincerely hoped that Myna would not get pregnant again, because two monsters like her would be impossible to handle. But since his mother was weak to her own desires, all he could do was pray to the gods.

Next, he went to check the trap he’d set in the river and was relieved to find a fish in it. He was delighted that he had secured today’s meal.

In truth, he had also wanted to secretly harvest some rather valuable medicinal herbs he was cultivating and take them to the Adventurer's Guild, but it wouldn’t be good if Peter found out the location. The crops Harold grew were already prone to being stolen. Medicinal herbs could be sold for a decent price. If that got out, the consequences would be irreversible.

On the way back, he saw some mushrooms, but it was easy to imagine that if people knew he could tell which ones were edible, he’d be saddled with unwanted jobs. He had received the very convenient **Magic Eye (Appraisal)** skill from the goddess, but Harold believed he couldn't let that be discovered until he had a reliable backer. If he wasn't careful, someone with a skill could be sold for a high price. He had already inherited a beautiful face from his mother. He had to act with the consideration of what might happen to him if his value as a "commodity" increased.

Keeping an eye on Peter to make sure he didn't trip while happily swinging a wooden stick, Harold headed back to the village. He was about to put his hand on the door to leave the fish at home before taking Peter to his house when he heard a woman's flirtatious cry. It must have also sounded like a pained voice, because Peter tried to open the door, and Harold instinctively stopped him.

“What’s wrong? If she’s in pain or something, we’ve gotta call someone.”

“Not now. Let’s go to your house first, Peter.”

He had a very bad feeling.

Harold knew all too well who Myna had linked arms with when they disappeared. Besides, even if that weren’t the case, he couldn't imagine it was a situation a child should see.

He tried to drag him away by force, but Peter took advantage of Harold's pale-faced hesitation and threw the door open.

A scream immediately rang out.

It was a simple fact that when a child screamed, adults would gather. What's more, the one screaming was Peter who, despite being mischievous, never lied and the location was the house of the village’s number one landmine of a woman.

Harold suppressed his own nausea as he rubbed the back of Peter, who was already vomiting in front of the house, his face pale. The door to the house was wide open, and the disheveled state of his parent and her partner was exposed to the villagers, but Harold was more worried about the scar on the young boy's heart than Myna's shame.

The ones carrying on inside the house were, just as Harold had imagined, Myna and Ronald.

Harold was worn out by the shouting and screaming from Ronald’s parents and Myna, and by the scornful looks from the villagers that branded him the son of a sinner. The only saving grace was perhaps Peter’s testimony that “Harold tried to stop me, but I went in anyway.”

He didn't have a shred of sympathy for his mother, who had been caught with a twelve-year-old boy. Seeing Myna, who not only refused to apologize but was trying to win over the men around her with flirtatious behavior, Harold felt the nausea he had just suppressed rising up again. 

Fortunately, there was nothing left in his stomach, so all he could do was rub his stomach. No one wants to see their mother in such a state.

The conversation turned to compensation, but Myna just screamed hysterically that she wasn’t at fault, making a proper discussion impossible.

In the end, the discussion continued late into the night, but Harold, being a child, was made to stay at his grandparents' house. His grandparents also said, "We can't leave our grandson alone," and when they offered to go home with him, the villagers must have realized it was pointless to talk with Myna alone, because the meeting was disbanded for the day.

The next shock to Harold and his family, who had spent a sleepless night, strangely wide awake despite being tired, came the following morning.
