Harold and his family, who had moved to the village where his grandmother used to live, found their new life surprisingly relaxing, to the point of being almost perplexing. They had certainly come to an even more rural area where monsters appeared, and merchants came by even less frequently which could be considered inconvenient in some ways. 

But at least there was no chance Harold’s parents would ever dream of coming to such a place.  
Just the fact that he could expect no visits from them was enough to make his social life simpler, and that in itself was a relief.

The medicinal herbs Harold had brought with him were very welcome here. The only problem, perhaps, was that because they had left their previous village in a hurry, they had some minor financial worries.

It wasn't that they were living extravagantly, but since they had just moved, they hadn't been able to start a field yet. Even if they did, crops wouldn't grow immediately after planting seeds. The same went for the medicinal herbs he had been cultivating. The harvest wouldn't stabilize right away.

Which meant they’d have to procure their own meat. However, Harold had never been very good with a bow in the first place, and the one he had was thrown away by his former mother, who he now pretended never existed, so he hadn't been able to practice since. 

Even if he set small traps, the monsters that appeared in this region were larger than in his previous village. Rabbits and the like were their prey and were hard to find.

Troubled, Harold searched for a solution, exploring hunting methods in the adventurer's reference room within the Adventurer's Guild. He felt a little grateful to the local lord for ensuring he was taught how to read.

Among the materials, he found a description of how to hunt using magic. Harold's Dimensional Storage was, in a way, a type of magic. He thought he might be able to use this. Deciding to take a chance, Harold went to an open, empty lot.

"Let's see, if I remember correctly..."

He held out his right hand and focused his mind. Then, he visualized it. He imagined magical energy as a combustible material, the oxygen in the air, and the heat necessary to start the reaction. He prompted the reaction exactly as described in the materials, which resembled a chemistry textbook.

"Fire."

For a moment, a sizable flame erupted, and a startled Harold hurriedly extinguished it. He then looked around, breathing a sigh of relief when he confirmed no one had seen him.

After that, he visualized a small fire, and when that succeeded, he began to test his limits little by little, considering how much energy he had left.

By the time the sun set, he was back home, properly making dinner with his grandparents. He was careful to maintain the image of a perfectly well-behaved boy in front of them— he absolutely did not want them to think he was anything like _those_ parents of his.

After the two were sound asleep, Harold pondered in his futon. Fire wasn't suitable for hunting if he was thinking about money, as it could burn the fur and feathers. The elements Harold had his eye on were ice and wind. He planned out his practice for the next day in his mind and closed his eyes.

When he fell asleep, he was in a floral space.

All around him were flowers, flowers, and more flowers.

_(This is a dream.)_

It was such a fantastical sight that the thought came instantly. As he wondered what to do, a voice that sounded as if it were suppressing all emotion called out his name from his past life: "Satou Haru."

He turned around to see a woman with long, cream-colored hair and slightly droopy blue eyes. The beauty mark under her eye was sexy. She had a distinctly feminine and curvaceous figure. Her clothes, reminiscent of a mythological deity, looked familiar.

"Ah, you're the goddess."

"Don't just say, 'you're the goddess.' I am one of the two great deities. Worship me, revere me, prostrate yourself before me."

"Ah, well, my life hasn't exactly been safe and secure, so my faith is a bit weak."

Harold replied to the somewhat exasperated-sounding goddess with a bright smile.

"For your information, I am far kinder than that man they call the 'main god,' who has absolutely no judgment! And unlike that fool of a god, I don't permit summoning magic, and I even clean up the messes! Why _don’t_ you worship me?!"

That must be why the inhabitants of this world worship the male 'main god,' Harold thought with a bitter expression. Human beings tend to gravitate toward what is convenient. When something happens, the main god is the one who helps. He could guess that was how it was framed. In short, people from other worlds and reincarnated individuals were likely just pawns to ensure their own safety.

However, from Harold's perspective, perhaps because he was apparently killed by being caught in the crossfire, he felt he could still have more faith in the goddess.

It seemed she had summoned Harold into her dream because she couldn't bear to see him get the short end of the stick again due to the aftershocks of the male god's actions. He tilted his head, not understanding what "aftershocks" she meant, but she said she came to grant him her **Divine Protection** to prevent the worst-case scenario, so he decided to gratefully accept it. She was surprisingly supportive. His opinion of her went up.

“Even so,” Harold remarked, “it sounds like the male god’s accidents happen pretty often.”

"There are. People who are hopelessly stupid can just disappear without returning to the cycle of reincarnation, but it weighs on my conscience to leave decent people as they are, you know?"

From the goddess's perspective, it seemed she had no use for anyone likely to cause trouble, regardless of their talent. _Was I dragged into this so forcefully because I seemed like I would be neither poison nor medicine?_ he wondered, as the goddess was full of complaints.

"Are you listening? You are to properly worship me, the **Goddess Forte**!!"

The goddess told him that the more faith he had, the further he’d be from disaster, and Harold nodded. Getting caught up in anything else was no laughing matter. At just ten years old, he’d already faced a major crisis, and now he found himself wanting to cling to a god— if only a little. This wasn’t about it being “better than becoming an orphan.”
