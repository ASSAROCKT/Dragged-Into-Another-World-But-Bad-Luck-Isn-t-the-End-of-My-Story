Both Harold and Aaron had work to do other than hunting. Because of that, the next time the two of them met was three days later.

And Harold was left dumbfounded by how easily Aaron had learned elemental and physical enhancement magic. Harold had learned it by painstakingly memorizing materials that were forbidden from being checked out from the guild library, sometimes having guild staff teach him characters, and thinking with all his might. To see Aaron casually pull it off with a simple "somehow" right after being taught made him feel a little envious.

_(Talent is terrifying...)_

Aaron hadn't been very good at reading and writing, as his father had passed away during the period when he would have learned his alphabets, throwing his life into chaos. He took this opportunity to start studying literacy with Harold. Perhaps because people wanted to support the two ten-year-old boys who were studying so hard in the guild's study room, despite not having much time, the staff members were happy to teach them whenever they went to ask questions.

The guild staff, dispatched from the Adventurer's Association, were educated in the Royal Capital. They were rotated to different posts every few years to prevent corruption. This system was put in place after an incident during the reign of a king several generations ago.

"Studying is a good thing. There are many people who think that stories from decades ago don't apply to them and that they'll never be deceived."

The young man at the guild reception desk said this with a distant look in his eyes.

Apparently, with the recent increase in such cases, there were requests from victims' families for search parties. It wasn't a mission that would be entrusted to two children, but he spoke up to prevent these diligent boys from falling victim to those who prey on children like them.

"It's common for people who go to work in other towns to get ripped off and not receive much pay," Aaron said.

"They look down on you if you can't read or write," Harold added.

It might not be a conversation children should be having, but living in this world, it was something you frequently witnessed or became a party to. The presence of someone who would warn them about these things was precious.

The young man, smiling at the two boys before him, unleashed a bolt of lightning on three men who were trying to attack them from behind. The boy with wheat-colored hair that looked golden depending on the light was the one more sensitive to such things. He turned to look, but the men had already been collected, and there was nothing there.

To think they would attempt a crime inside the guildâ€” he spat and clicked his tongue inwardly, but the fact that he showed none of it on his face was a glimpse of his noble upbringing.

In cities and prosperous regional towns, half or more of the staff are women, but in a desolate place like this, over eighty percent of the staff is male. This isn't a matter of being sorted by competence. It is simply a measure to prevent work from being disrupted by those who would complain about gender. Large cities have staff members who were once high-ranking adventurers, and because of their scale, they have many reception windows and a degree of flexibility. The more rural a place is, the smaller the facility, and consequently, the smaller the reception area.

_(It's a problem when people go after kids who show a certain amount of promise.)_

The one the young man had his eye on was Harold. A commoner boy had understood the mechanism by which magic occurs and had even managed to teach it to his friend.

He was certainly impressed by Aaron's high absorption rate. But he also saw something special in Harold... in his sensibility to discover that talent and his understanding that allowed him to actually teach it.

Many people register as adventurers. Some come looking to earn a little pocket money when they're struggling to get by. Some manage to get back on their feet from there, while others can never climb back up. His favorability was high for these boys, who listened to his warnings and proceeded with caution.

"Aaron-kun, Harold-kun. The assessment is done. You wanted to take the edible parts home, right?"

"Yes! Thank you very much!"

Aaron's face lit up, and he replied cheerfully. He might have already been getting a little tired of studying. On top of that, he had younger siblings at home who loved meat. Before, he had worked alone and sometimes had his kills stolen by Scarcrows, or had to flee without his prize after encountering a larger monster. So, he was happy that he was now able to feed his family properly.

The young man nodded, thinking that Harold, who also said his thanks while looking through a document and saying, "Just this last part," might be interested in learning for its own sake.

Harold desired knowledge so that he could live in a gentler, safer world, even if just by a little. He didn't know the specifics, but he was apparently getting the short end of the stick from the so-called main god's screw-ups, so he wanted to acquire any power he could to lessen that impact.

_(I did look up the method of worship for the goddess, but there are no temples or anything... though I have assembled what you'd call a kamidana(altar) in Japan before.)_

He thought this to himself in a corner of his mind as he finished reading and closed the book.
