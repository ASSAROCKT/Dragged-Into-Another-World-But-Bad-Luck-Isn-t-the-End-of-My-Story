The last thing the man saw was the flamming red fire.

It started from carelessness at the man’s workplace. His short-tempered boss had left a lit cigarette on an ashtray. A draft from the air conditioner blew a stack of papers onto it, and the flame grew.

The man, who had been organizing the records room by himself, was late to notice the fire. When he casually looked outside, wondering, ”Is it hot in here?” he saw the red glow. He rushed to the door, but the knob was already scorching hot and wouldn't turn.

The door caught fire, then the shelves, then the documents. He died from carbon monoxide poisoning, and his life came to an end.

After he died, now a spirit, he stood in the queue of the dead, patiently waiting his turn. If I was going to die anyway, he thought placidly, I should have finished those games I had piled up.

As a perfectly ordinary salaryman, he had no deep regrets, nor any strong attachments to the world. Seeing a fire like that, he reasoned with himself, yeah, of course I’d die.

When he finally stood before the gatekeeper, he was met with a shout that made him tilt his head in confusion. “You’re not on the list!!”

Not on the list? You’ve got to be kidding me, he thought, still having the presence of mind to find it funny.

He was guided to another area where a handsome, black-haired man, looking exhausted to the bone, approached him and bowed deeply.

“My sincerest apologies…! It was a mistake!!”

“A mistake?”

The man, whose name was Satou Haru, tilted his head again, genuinely confused. The youth, who had a single horn growing from his head, explained that he was an oni. _Well, I’m dead, so it makes a strange kind of sense that a government official would be an oni,_ Haru thought, his mind wandering in an odd direction as he prompted the official to continue.

“Satou Haru-sama, you were meant to survive the fire. A passerby was supposed to witness it through a window and report it just in the nick of time.”

“Ah, I see…”

“However… that person was suddenly struck and killed by a runaway car, and what’s more, the driver was no longer even in the vehicle… It’s a situation that even we don’t understand…”

The oni’s face was pale as he tried to explain. Haru felt a bit of pity for him and offered a wry smile.

“Well, it’s alright. I wasn’t particularly attached to life anyway.”

At those words, the tension in the oni snapped, and he burst into tears. For a handsome man, he was an ugly crier.

“I’m so sorry…! You were supposed to live to a ripe old age…! My supervisor told me we can’t accept you into heaven or hell… This is impossible, what am I supposed to do?! There’s no way I can bring someone back to life who’s already turned to bones!”

Haru, the one who was actually dead, was taken aback by the wailing oni and simply waited for him to calm down. _If there's a waiting room, shouldn't I just stay there?_ he wondered, but figured it probably wasn't that simple. Still, he waited for the oni to stop crying, thinking it was probably better than a boss screaming nonsensical orders or a client making last-minute changes to a project. Once he’d calmed down, the oni sniffled and shuffled through his documents.

“My apologies for that outburst… In any case, because of this, would you be willing to reincarnate in another world?”

“I don’t really get why, and it’s not like I’m desperate to live, so…”

Haru had enjoyed novels and anime with that sort of plot. But those stories were fun precisely because they happened to other people. Sensing a great deal of trouble ahead, he took a step back. It wasn't his fault he died, but his family had already passed on, and he was rather looking forward to having a drink with them in the afterlife. He had nothing left to protect, which was the source of his indifference towards his own life.

“Oh, you don’t get a choice in the matter. Your only options are to reincarnate in my world with my blessing and skills, or to reincarnate in my world with nothing at all.”

A soft voice came from behind him. He turned to see a woman with a stunning figure. She had straight, cream-colored hair, slightly drooping blue eyes, and an expression that was beautiful, yet seemed to be scheming or amused by something. If goddesses or angels existed, he imagined they would look just like her.

“Wait. So I have to go, no matter what? I was kind of hoping to have a drink with my old man now that I’m dead.”

“Impossible. You’re outside the jurisdiction of the death registry here. Thanks to some incompetent deity in my world casting a summoning spell, I’m taking you in. If you refuse, I’ll just dump you into the new world without anything. Honestly, since it’s not my fault, you should consider the choice I’m giving you an act of mercy.”

The landmine vibes are off the charts.

Haru was honestly against the whole idea, but he had a strong feeling that being sent over with nothing would be far, far worse. If things get too bad, I’ll just find an easy way to kick the bucket over there, he thought, his own line of reasoning becoming rather grim as he reluctantly accepted the offer to be reincarnated.

It turned out the whole incident was caused by someone in another world trying to summon a Saintess. The person driving the car had been that Saintess. when she was summoned, the driverless car lost control and ran over the young man who was supposed to report the fire. That guy, for his part, had been thrilled about reincarnating.

Youth is a wonderful thing, the salaryman, now past thirty, thought with a bitter smile.

And so, it was decided that Haru would be welcomed into another world. As a commoner.

As for the beautiful woman, who claimed to be one of those gods, she said she would grant him skills and a blessing. This all sounded incredibly tedious.

“I want to live an easy life, so skills that make daily living easier would be great. I don’t want to struggle to find a job; I’d like to work at a place with good conditions and live a normal life.”

“Is that it? You don’t want to be a Hero or be surrounded by women? Most people ask for overpowered combat skills or charm abilities. After that, it’s usually healing or production skills.”

“That stuff sounds like it would lead to regret later on. It probably doesn’t suit my personality or my station in life. I think I’d prefer one of those production-type skills you mentioned.”

Having been a corporate drone who was yelled at by his boss and had his overtime pay arbitrarily cut, he knew he wasn't the stuff of main characters. Giving him an overpowered combat skill would be a complete waste.

“But I would like that one thing. The dimensional storage-type skill you see all the time.”

The ability he’d seen so often in fiction seemed incredibly useful. Just being able to store food, which could be hard to stockpile depending on the place, would be a huge advantage.

“You really are a boring man. Oh, well. Since I’m in charge of you now, I need you to be at least moderately successful… you know, it’s a matter of my divine prestige, isn’t it?”

What prestige is there to speak of when you’re forcing this on someone who doesn’t even want it? Haru thought, his gaze distant.

After some discussion, she granted his request for a production-type skill, giving him the Job Skill of "Alchemist." She also handed over a magic bag and an appraisal eye, insisting they were “necessary,” and then, before he could even reply, she declared, “Alright, you’re all set,” and sent him on his way.

“I didn’t actually agree to any of that, though,” Haru muttered as he felt himself falling.
