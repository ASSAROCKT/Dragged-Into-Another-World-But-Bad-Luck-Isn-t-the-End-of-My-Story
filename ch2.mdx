Having been reincarnated this way, Haru became a commoner named Harold.

No matter where he looked, all he could see were fields and trees. Monsters roamed the mountain behind his house. Although it was the very definition of a backwater village, Harold was living a perfectly ordinary life.

_(Well, for some reason, my face got a massive upgrade)_

Not that this made him particularly interested in the opposite sex. He just peacefully swung a slightly small Shovel. For Harold, who had been a man in his thirties in his previous life, there was the very real ethical problem that girls his own age were little kids. At this rate, he figured he wouldn’t be able to pursue romance until he was past his previous life’s age, but he reconsidered that it wasn't a particular problem.

Harold was just a farmer, not a nobleman. There were no political considerations to worry about. On top of that, his family situation had already caused those around him to keep their distance.

Wiping away his sweat, he turned when his mother called him. She seemed to have grown a little frail since his father left, a fleeting beauty that drew people’s gazes.

He put on a smile for his mother and waved.

Harold had heard that his mother, Myna, was a great beauty in her youth. His father had been reasonably good-looking, too. Good-looking, but he never did any work, preferring to flirt with women instead. From a young age, Harold had thought, “Ah, this household is hopeless.” The reason was that his mother never seemed to work either.

Harold was, for all intents and purposes, raised by his maternal grandparents. He had no idea how his diligent and gentle grandparents had produced a daughter like his mother who did absolutely nothing.

“Harold, with a face as beautiful as yours, you don’t have to work so hard.”

For a moment, Harold’s expression went flat at his mother's words, but he quickly recovered and gave a troubled smile. “It’s because I like doing it.”

Because of her beauty, his mother had been showered with all sorts of gifts from men. It was terrifying how she could wrap them around her finger just by acting a little sad. He couldn't help but think that the reason she had such values wasn't her family, but the men of the village.

And so, the women of the village were on edge about her words, which seemed aimed at corrupting her son. They couldn't stand the thought of another freeloader who lived off handouts without working, just like Harold’s parents.

“Hey, Myna-san!”

He didn’t let it show on his face, but inwardly he was disgusted. A short distance away was his childhood acquaintance, who was two years older than him. The fact that his mother would put on a flirty face for a mere twelve-year-old boy was revolting. 

The childhood friend, who fancied himself about being the Hero, was apparently talented enough that he was set to attend the Royal Academy.

Ronald was certainly someone who drew attention.

_(I mean, the guy can annihilate a horde of goblins with just a wooden stick.)_

Even the Adventurer’s Guild had high hopes for him. He was reasonably good-looking, too, and already had girls fawning over him despite his age. Harold's mother, Myna, was one of them.

As for Harold, he was often forced to be Ronald's sparring partner or baggage carrier, so he actually disliked the boy. He truly wished from the bottom of his heart that Ronald had just stayed in the royal capital instead of coming back.

Harold tilled the fields to make a living and set traps to catch rabbits and fish. He could clearly see that if this boy Ronald came and bossed him around, his time for work would decrease, and he would once again be completely dependent on his grandparents.

"Hey. Take my stuff back to my house."

"No way. I've still got a lot to do, and I don't have time for that."

When Harold said this with an exasperated tone, his mother slapped him across the cheek. She told him to do as Ronald said, while Myna herself linked arms with the boy. Harold shot a cold glare at their retreating backs and let out a sigh. Ronald glanced back at Harold, the corner of his mouth turned up in a smirk. His feeling of superiority was palpable.

Since Harold’s parents in his past life had been normal people, he was more than a little put off by this scene, but the two disappeared without noticing.

_(What a pain.)_

Utterly exasperated, he reluctantly picked up the baggage. He knew that even if people pitied him, no one would step in to help. After all, getting involved with Harold meant having to deal with _that_ mother. It was understandable that they wouldn’t want to get mixed up in that. Even so, he was thoroughly fed up with the fact that no one would even help him up and that Ronald’s outrageous behavior was allowed to continue.
