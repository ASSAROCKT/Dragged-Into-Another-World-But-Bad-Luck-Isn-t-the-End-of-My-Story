Aaron's sister, whose symptoms had improved, predictably refused the medicine, but Aaron kept smiling and made sure she drank every last drop. As a result, she made a full recovery, and he nodded in satisfaction, pleased that his sister was well again.

He put on a show of pondering what to do about being asked to worship the goddess. He wondered if he needed an altar like Harold's, he lacked Harold’s strange knack needed to build a household shrine like that, so he gave up on the idea.

_(According to my old man, gods can hold grudges, so I’d better not make anything weird…)_

In the Royal Capital, a **Hero** or a **Saintess** appears once every few years. They bear the **Divine Protection** of the main god, **Forzato**. It was an unreasonable state of affairs where just being seen as an enemy by them was enough to bring misfortune upon you.

Conversely, it was said that being liked by them would bring you good luck, but when such phenomena occur, it's inevitable that even those with holy **Job Skills** are surrounded by people in power and begin to change.

Aaron's father had a period where he was made to attend the academy in the Royal Capital. At that time, a man who had been granted the **Sage** **Job Skill** was summoned. That man also had **Forzato's** protection. At first, the man was quiet, but the moment he realized his own power and the god's protection, he became a tyrant.

Having heard such stories, Aaron could only tilt his head when asked if divine protection was such a good thing. However, Harold showed no signs of arrogance. From that, he began to think that the **Goddess Forte** might be a more respectable being than the male god known as the main god. 

He didn't know what Harold was wary of, but he had asked him to keep the matter of his protection a secret. He had no intention of being so heartless as to sell out his friend's secret.

That he, too, was granted a Job Skill may have been the goddess's doing.

Though he couldn't see her form, she had said in his dream, "Please take care of my Haru."

"It was a dream, but it wasn't just a dream..."

A silver bracelet with a green stone, given to him in the dream, was now on his wrist. When he poured magic into it, it took the shape of a bow and could fire arrows of any element he focused on. The only drawback was that it consumed a great deal of magical power.

At the end of winter, he consulted with Harold, who said, "It might be better not to use it in front of people too much." Fearing they would be attacked and have it stolen, the two of them quietly nodded in agreement.

"You know, I get the feeling if we stick our heads out we are more likely to get caught up in the main god's screw-ups."

He couldn't bring himself to joke to his serious-faced friend, "Isn't that an evil god, not a main god?" Harold himself was just a little impressed, thinking, _So this is how skills are granted._

After that, the two friends continued to rely on the adults around them, studying to avoid scams and hunting and gardening to survive. However, their efforts would backfire, leading to the arrival of a certain invitation.

It happened in the year they turned twelve.

Within the Adventurer's Guild, talk had spread that, "Those two are hiding it, so we don't know what they have, but they seem to have skills." The receptionist at the guild, who had been gradually helping the two level up their studies, had reported them to the headquarters in the Royal Capital, as per national regulations.

As a result, an invitation was sent through the Adventurer's Guild, telling them to come to the Royal Capital to properly study magic and other skills.

"Wait, is it mandatory?"

Harold made a face of pure disgust, while Aaron pondered, "But I have things to do at home..."

Incidentally, the reason Harold didn't want to go was that he knew his lecherous childhood friend was there.

"It's absolutely mandatory. Because you two probably have skills, right? Even if you don't, children who can use a certain level of magic have to study in the Royal Capital due to the danger and for management purposes. If you go now, you might even get to meet the **Hero**-sama."

"No, I don't particularly want to meet him."

The result of their serious, diligent work was a trip to the capital, and where one would normally rejoice, he looked utterly disgusted.

"But since it's a national policy, the government will cover your travel expenses and the cost of studying at the academy. All you have to pay for is food and luxury items. There's a guild there, too, so for diligent kids like you, it won't be a burden you can't handle. Isn't it a bargain to be able to pursue your studies with those terms?"

They went home to discuss it, but the reaction from both families was, "It's the law, so..." Harold, who wanted to avoid meeting the harbinger of misfortune (Ronald) from the bottom of his heart, looked miserable but reconsidered that it wasn't something worth defying the entire country over.

_(I have a really, really bad feeling about this.)_

It seemed Harold’s hard work to survive had, yet again, brought him nothing but bad luck.
