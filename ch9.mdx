He thought he would struggle through his first winter in a new land, but it was decidedly easier than usual. At least, for Harold and his family.

Without his meddling parents or the childhood friend (the older one) who would sometimes steal their firewood, preparing for winter was easier than ever before.

_(I wonder if my that woman(mother) is still alive.)_

He knew she was a hopeless parent, but he couldn't bring himself to wish she were dead. His face soured as if he’d bitten down on a bitter bug, thinking it was probably because of the memories he carried over from his past life.

Still, it was better to have escaped than to live in a place like that. Even Harold didn't want to live somewhere he might be harmed at any moment, and he knew what had been said to his grandparents. His grandparents had scolded and admonished that mother of his. She was the one who ignored them. Knowing this, Harold felt he had to prove he was a serious, hard worker so that the two of them wouldn't be hurt any further.

As he was watering the medicinal herbs that he had moved into pots and brought inside, he heard a knock on the door. Then, he heard Aaron's voice, "Haru, are you there!?" Hearing the sound of the relentless snow blowing outside, he frowned, wondering what was going on. 

When he left his room, his grandfather, Eugene, had already opened the door, and his pale-faced friend was approaching.

"Do you have any herbs for fever!? My sister's fever won't go down!!"

Grabbing his frantic friend's shoulders, he said, "Calm down." As if brought back to his senses by Harold's voice, Aaron quieted down a little.

"For now, take me to her."

With the snowstorm, the village’s healer wouldn’t be able to come. He couldn't carelessly hand over herbs without knowing the cause. If her symptoms worsened because of it, the situation would be disastrous. Harold didn't want his relationship with his new friend to turn sour for those reasons.

Harold himself was an amateur, so he knew this wasn't ideal, but he had few options. Fortunately, Harold had the **Magic Eye (Appraisal)** given to him by the **Goddess Forte**. It had specs worthy of being called a cheat, and combined with his given **Job Skill: Alchemist**, preparing medicine was not impossible. 

In any case, he couldn't make a judgment without seeing her condition, so he offered to go with him. His grandparents were hesitant, but Harold insisted, thinking that a life was on the line and that, at present, his eyes were the only way to determine which herbs were needed. He was thankful that Aaron's house was close enough to be seen from his window.

He gathered up his stock of herbs and dashed through the blizzard to Aaron's house.

His intuition told him that thinking about things like personal information would lead to a major incident, so he quickly used his **Magic Eye** on her as soon as he saw her.

"It's pneumonia."

The **Magic Eye** showed that she had developed it from a worsening cold. It seemed to have progressed rapidly. Aaron had mentioned that she wasn't very strong to begin with.

The smell of the herbs he began to grind with a mortar and pestle filled the room. There was no medicine master in this village. The old medicine woman from the next village likely wouldn't be able to come for a while, given the weather outside.

In front of Harold's eyes was something like an LCD screen that only he could see. A detailed recipe was displayed on it. The way each step lit up might have been a kindness from the goddess.

As he followed it to make the medicine, a worriedly fidgeting Aaron asked for the umpteenth time, "Is she going to be okay?"

“That depends on her strength,” Harold replied, watching the bitter looking medicine simmer. He then poured it into bottles, searching for a cup of the right size. Everything he was doing was thanks to Forte’s skill. If this information came from a god, then it was as reliable as a professional’s judgment or so he told himself.

_(Still, I feel like my skills have gotten noticeably stronger ever since I made that little shrine and started leaving offerings.)_

He didn’t have any combat skills, but the improvement in his magical eye was almost alarming. This time, he was indebted to both his **Job Skill** and his **Magic Eye**, so he had no complaints. He just felt he had to make sure these exceptional gifts weren't exploited by the wrong people.

"Have her drink this medicine after every meal, poured up to this line. Even if her symptoms improve, make sure she drinks it until it's all gone."

"O-Okay... You really know your stuff."

"Nah, it's the goddess's **Divine Protection**."

Perhaps because it was just the two of them, Aaron's eyes went wide at the casually spoken words. When Harold added, "You absolutely have to keep this a secret," Aaron nodded like a broken doll.

People with a god's protection were few, but they existed. And such people were often targeted by the church or those in power. Therefore, Aaron decided he would take this secret to his grave.

"But once she's better, you have to worship her."

"I absolutely will."

As it turned out, Aaron’s mother came back in the morning. Apparently, she had been out picking herbs to make a tea for her sick daughter and got stuck when the blizzard hit. An adventurer had persuaded her to stay at the guild. She bowed her head over and over to a bewildered Harold when she saw her daughter's calm breathing. His brother was sleeping soundly in the room.

Furthermore, on the following day, the goddess paid a visit to a sleeping Harold and exclaimed excitedly, "You’ve done well, increasing my followers!!!"
