"It's been getting colder lately."

His breath formed a white mist, and realizing he might have been dressed a little too lightly he decided to put on a jacket after getting home.

Since he started working with Aaron, their hunts had been going well, and they had secured a decent amount of food.

In the end, being forced out of the old village early by the harassment might have been a good thing. As he was thinking this, he shot down a monster bird with an ice attack that had come to peck at the radish leaves and cabbages that were finally beginning to mature. He picked it up with a quiet sigh, noting how many of them there were.

He learned it from Aaron's mother after sharing some of his harvest, but apparently, the vegetables Harold grew were tastier than others. He had thought they seemed a bit large, but he wondered if there was really that much of a difference.

(_For some reason, the birds don’t go after Grandma’s patch nearly as much._)

It was difficult not to see the creatures that persistently and tenaciously targeted his crops as enemies. To Harold, they were detestable birds, but since they were also edible, he calmed himself down.

Harold hadn't realized it, but in addition to his Job Skill, Magic Eye, and Dimensional Storage, he also possessed a skill that was not given to him by the goddess. It was affecting his crops and herbs. The herbs he grew had a higher purchase price than normal ones. Unaware of this fact himself, the Adventurer's Guild staff thought, "He probably has some kind of plant-related skill."

"Haru!!"

Snapping back to his senses at the sound of Aaron's voice, who had finally started calling him by his nickname, Harold saw Aaron's eyes sparkling as he stared at the bird in his hand.

"Isn't that a Brown Crested Fowl! Wow, it's so plump!!"

"Looks like it ate its fill of my cabbages."

Seeing the cabbages where Harold was looking, Aaron, who had been excited, shut his mouth. One corner of the patch had been messily devoured. A net had been placed over the remaining parts, but the damage was severe. His friend's golden eyes were ice-cold.

"Well, let's just think of it as proof you grow good stuff. We can sell the feathers, too."

"It's complicated, because the ones that have gotten a taste for it keep coming back for more..."

Harold replied to Aaron, then placed the birds on a cart to take them to the **Adventurer's Guild**.

“Have you got firewood ready?”

“Yeah, pretty much. I gathered more than I think I’ll need, but I’ve got no idea how cold it gets around here.”

"Your grandma will probably check it later. I hate how it's nothing but dried meat once the snow starts falling."

Aaron pouted, but Harold, who had spotted a rare white Crested Fowl among the brown ones, was feeling a slightly bad premonition. He watched intently as Harold moved some of the vegetables into the storehouse. He thought he was probably overthinking it, but monsters sometimes did the unthinkable, which made him a little anxious.

The creature, which was undeniably a monster even if it persistently targeted Harold's vegetables instead of people, was handed over to the **Adventurer's Guild**. It was waiting to be dismantled.

"You want to take the meat home?"

"Are you sure!?"

"My grandpa and grandma don't eat that much meat. Your younger brother and sister eat a lot, don't they, Aaron?"

"At my place, if you don't eat it when it's there, you might not see it again for a while, so it's a war."

It would be nice if they had it every time, but there were also times with no harvest. As if their growing bodies needed meat, the consumption rate between Aaron's house and Harold's was on a completely different level. Harold ate a fair amount himself, but the difference in the number of people was likely a big factor.

Incidentally, the food Harold shared often came back cooked by Aaron's mother. The taste of another family's cooking was delicious in its own right. Harold's own mother was a terrible cook, so the first time it happened, he had been strangely moved. He had grown up on his grandmother's cooking, which was also delicious. But it was the side dishes from Aaron's house that were meals geared toward a young person.

Once the dismantling was finished, they had the feathers, which could be sold, bought from them. The feathers of Crested Fowl-type birds, the normal brown or black ones, weren't that expensive. The demand was higher for their meat rather than their feathers. So, in truth, selling the meat would have made more money. 

However, time didn't pass inside Harold's **Dimensional Storage**, so just putting it inside allowed for long-term preservation. Given the time of year, it was good to have as much food as possible. Believing it was better to be safe than sorry, he had stockpiled a certain amount of food.
